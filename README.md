# telephonepodcast
I wrote this code during the first COVID lockdown as a function to be pasted into Twilio functions.  I set up a service within Twilio that would invoke the function when someone called a telephone number - the Javascript code would then play the latest MP3 from a podcast over the phone.

For this you will need to set up a Twilio account and know the URL of the RSS feed for the podcast that you wish to play over the phone.  This must be a valid podcast RSS feed - to check the validity of your podcast URL, you can use a validator such as the one provided by Podbase: https://podba.se/validate/
